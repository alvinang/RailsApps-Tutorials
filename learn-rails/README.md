## Learn Rails Tutorial by Daniel Kehoe

This is a tutorial from Daniel Kehoe's book learn rails [Learn Rails]: http://learn-rails.com/. He is the founder of [RailsApps]: http://railsapps.github.io/ that provides rails tutorials for building specific projects. 

This app is built using:
+ Ruby 2.1.0
+ Rails 4.0.0

on Jan 24th, 2014. Instead of using my gmail account to send out emails, I modified it to send emails using [Mandrill]: http://mandrill.com/. 

This is a great tutorial especially for those interested in learning about Gibbon gem (by mailchimp, updated recently) to build a subscription based site. 

Also, the gem [rails_layout]: https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout is extremely helpful when building apps really quickly. They help setup your rails application with a frontend framework (Zurb Foundation or Bootstrap). 

Feel free to contact me via GitHub if you have any questions, thanks!
